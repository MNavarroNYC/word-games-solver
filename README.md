# word-games-solver
Just some code I wrote to help solve some basic word games that required having a large vocabulary. This all mainly started yesterday after I got stuck on Letter Boxed on the NYT website.


The NYT Letter Boxed Solver

To use the Letter Boxed Solver input first how many guesses you have to solve the puzzle in. Then type in each letter from the box sides in, letter by letter AND in order. After running it will return a list of all eligible words that match the Letter Boxed rules in descending order. Pick a word and try it out in the game, then type in the last letter of the word you inputed into the game to get a new list of words that start with that letter. This will continue until you beat the game or run out of guesses.
